                The instructions are simple. Use WASD or the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around. Using this, collect the money that's appearing from thin air to generate profit.<br>
                However, don't drop money, as you will lose the profit it could've given you. And if you lose too much profit, you lose the game. It's simple.<br>
                To keep a check over this, the game has two score counters. The one on the left counts your highest balance of the game, the one on your right counts your current balance. </br>
                That may seem complicated, and so the game has a bar under your player. All you have to remember is that while there's no red on it, you're okay. </br>
                Now go ahead, have fun! And remember, the more money falls, the harder it gets.
